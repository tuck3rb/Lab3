Name: Tiger Escape
Intent: You are a tiger that has escaped your enclosure at the zoo (per the poem) your goal is to find freedom in the forest. To get there you must leave the zoo, journey across the city and the suburbs to finally reach the forest. Along the way there are challenging and mind-bending obstacles.
Narrative structure: The game is based on the tale of Nael, a six year-old who wrote the poem “The Tiger.” Now we continue our trek as that tiger.
Mechanics: Click buttons in the menu, use WASD or Arrow Keys to move around and Spacebar to jump. The X key can be used if you get stuck jumping.
Aesthetics: Our tiger is drawn cartoonishly, to match the age of the poem’s author and the font and tilemap follow suit. We have a three layer scrolling parallax background with green hills, trees, and clouds for when you’re high up in the sky.
Joys/Struggles: An enjoyable part of creating the game was making the challenges to each level and additionally watching others try and fail over and over again.
For a moment we had a struggle where dialog prevented transitions for scenes. We determined soon thereafter, however, that it was because we were spawning on a dialog box. If we spawned a step backward, everything worked as intended.

First we started by Garrett finding a sprite and proposing the idea of basing the game in the poem. Then Tucker found the tiles and created the parallax so as to match the Farm Jumper game created in class. Then Garrett created the transitions between scenes while Tucker made the platform levels. Garrett then added in the text and solved the dialog bug we had. Tucker then added music and solved the jumping glitch as well as added in trails. Then we wrote the README and uploaded the game.
